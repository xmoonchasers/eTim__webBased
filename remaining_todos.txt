SpoonPi
	[x] Investigate fingerprint suddenly failing bug -> adding a timeout to read seems to have solved the problem
ForkPi
	Initialize options table and ensure option name is not modified
Others
	[x] Change field action string on logs to was_allowed boolean
	refactor denied reason strings to new table
	Shoebox
	Separate Forkpi and Spoonpi users in database
		SpoonPi: read-only permission on all tables except logs
		ForkPi:  read and write permission on all tables, but no update permission on column records_option.name
	SpoonPi Usability Test (May Week 02)
	ForkPi Usability Test (May Week 03)
	Dummy fingerprint and rfid scanner

	[.] Hash Fingerprint and let it have its own table


	
	
	options table: applies_to
		Attempt Limit
			The max streak of failed attempts where an RFID tag or fingerprint is presented and the wrong PIN is entered.<br/>This is to prevent guessing the PIN via brute force.
			Applies to: RFID+PIN users

		Lockout Time
			The amount of time to block the RFID tag or fingerprint from further use once the incorrect streak reaches the attempt limit.
			Applies to: RFID+PIN users

		Keypad Timeout
			The max amount of time between key presses. Exceed this and the attempt will be considered as failed.
			Applies to: RFID+PIN users, Fingerprint+PIN users

		Max Transaction Time
			The max amount of time between presenting two authentication tokens.
			Applies to: RFID+PIN users, Fingerprint+PIN users, RFID+Fingerprint users

		Lock Release Time
			The amount of time to release the lock upon a successful attempt.
			Applies to: Everyone

[x] write paper
	[x] Cost
	[x] Assembling the components
	[x] Testing the components
	[x] Introduction
	[x] Abstract
	[x] Results and discussion
[.] main.py and Swipe RFID polling at the same time causes crash - issue avoided since ForkPi and SpoonPi are never together on one machine
[x] delete old logs
[x] name editing must reflect with the RFID_UID and PIN
[x] lock out after entering wrong pin 5 times in a row
[x] save log
[x] Edit RFID UID
[x] Encode DB, passing of keypairs from views to templates
[x] flash messages lol
[x] salted passwords
[x] check valid pin and rfid uid
[x] check valid pin for editing
[x] PIN remove from pdf
[x] Deactivate/disable keypairs
[.] Option for 6 digit PIN - onchange disable all existing keypairs with 4-digit PIN
	[x] Or: Remove limits on max length; min length is 4
[.] Mass-delete disabled keypairs -> no longer needed since there is no mass disabling of keypairs
[.] Change key used to encrypt keypairs to AES key transferred using RSA -> used hashes instead
[x] Filter logs by date, allowed/denied, uid
[x] Change lock-out time / attempt limit
[x] Access ForkPi over the local network using its host name
[x] Beautification
	[x] Buttons must have a sort of margin around it.
	[x] Options: more presentable names
	[x] Color coding: red = denied
	[x] Date in Users
	[x] Visual cue for Admin in the Users
	[x] Notification if there are new users awaiting approval

[x] Signup Process
	[x] Check what sort of user and append the menu according to such.
	[x] Prevent access to certain views (users.py and options.py), if non-staff
	[.] Upon signup, is_superuser must be false (already done)
	[x] If user is inactive, do not allow login
	[%] if not superuser:
		Approve/Deny OR
		(
			if not staff
				[x] Promote to Admin
			else
				[x] Demote to Regular
			if active
				[x] Deactivate
			else
				[x] Activate
			[x] Delete
		)
	Raw text:
		Change sign-up process
		Admins can approve new users, edit db and view logs, in other words: (is_staff)
			- Users
			- Options
			- Logs
			- Keypairs
		Regular users can edit db and view logs, in other words: (is_superuser)
			- Logs
			- Keypairs
[x] Schema changes:
	[x] Keypair:
		[x] add field bytea fingerprint_template
		[x] separate hashes for pin and rfid_uid
	[x] Add table keypair_doors with fields
		[x] keypair_id
		[x] door_id
	[x Add table doors with fields
		[x] id
		[x] name
		[x] serial
	[x] Logs:
		[x] add field Boolean fingerprint_used
[.] Test if Pis can communicate over local network wirelessly using a router with no internet connection
	They cannot. D:
[x] Fingerprint scanner and rfid polling at the same time (Spoonpi)

# Why we cannot match fingers in forkpi:
	Multiple SpoonPis might cause simultaneous uploading to the forkpi scanner
	Someone might use SpoonPi to verify while someone is enrolling in ForkPi
	
[x] Register fingerprint via forkpi (April Week 01)
[x] Change the saving-to-db function (April Week 02)
[x] Handle case of 'Unable to get serial number'
[x] Authentication Mechanisms:
	[x] single factor fingerprint
	[x] single factor rfid
	[x] rfid + pin
	[x] fingerprint + pin
	[x] fingerprint + rfid
[x] Change the auth function (April Week 02)
[x] New keypair add doors
[x] Keypair - last_edited_by field
[x] Add door name to logs
[x] Fetch only keypairs that are mapped to this door
[x] Prevent entering keypair with no name, name must be unique
[.] BUG: Scan RFID close window while polling -> next poll causes crash -> non-blocking scan
	[.] Same with fingerprint -> non-blocking scan
	Still it is possible for multiple people to scan at the same time, just that it's less likely to happen
[x] Add a module which is for door administration (April Week 02)
[x] BUG: Can demote self -> if I am the only admin, will result in no admins able to approve new users
[x] Add options for transaction timer, allow timer, deny timer
[x] Modal dialog for editing keypair (prompt first for one of three auth factors)
[x] (Forkpi) Enter pin before allowing edit?
[x] Don't put the information in the invisible
[x] Just one textbox, but free to put anything
[x] ^ Above textbox should just do one scan for fingerprint
[x] refactor html in javascript
[x] Visual cues on fingerprint enrollment: "Remove finger", etc.
[.] Print pdf is not supported in Python 3.0-3.2 -> change to csv
[x] Investigate fingerprint class separation bug
[x] Autohide messages
[x] Add New Keypairs > PIN must be a password field
[x] Name (and other required fields) - red asterisk
	[x] Add New Keypair
	[x] Edit Keypair
	[x] Signup
	[x] Login
[x] Move deactivated keypairs to separate tab
[x] Base64 encoding instead of base16
[.] Pageinate logs (and maybe keypairs) -- Conflicts with CSV requirement

[x] Line 81 of fetch_templates, forkpi_db.py, add "is_active = TRUE" --> wait to remove finger must work
[x] Remove option to delete
[x] Impose PIN length = 4
[x] Authenticate modal
	[.] remove PIN (can be brute forced by admin) -- assume that admin won't brute force
	[x] only show what's available (e.g.: if no RFID, do not show scan RFID button)
[.] Separate the keypairs table view -- within each row, there are differences in the final column
[x] Disallow registering with only PIN / editing such that only PIN is left a.k.a.: Require RFID OR Fingerprint
	[x] Part 1: Register
	[x] Part 2: Editing
[x] Name should only editable in edit keypair
	[x] read-only in keypairs table	
[x] Pressing [ENTER] on modal-credential-text now triggers the Submit button
[x] CSV file (No more PDF on keypairs) for logs table
	[x] Parse logs table, write only visible rows to csv
	[x] Do not include credentials
[x] Put back lockouts for rfid
