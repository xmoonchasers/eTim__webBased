Raspberry Pi Setup

1.	Installing the OS
---------------------

	1.1.	Download NOOBS_vX_X_XX.zip from http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
			and send these files to your SD.

	1.2.	The SD Card must have the following specifications:

			1.2.1.	At least 8GB of data
			1.2.3.	Format system: FAT32
			1.2.3.	Allocation unit size: 8192 bytes

	1.3.	Insert SD Card to Raspberry Pi and boot

	1.4.	Once the installation window shows up, click on the checkbox
			for "Raspbian" and hit "I" (Install)

	1.5.	Default login information:

			1.5.1.	username: pi
			1.5.2.	password: raspberry

	1.6.	After the installation, a menu in blue background will pop up.
			(To access this menu again in the future, do "sudo raspi-config")
			Do the following:

			1.6.1.	Go to Option 3: "Enable Boot to Desktop/Scratch Choose 
			whether to boot into a desktop environment, Scratch, or the 
			command line" and hit enter.

			1.6.2.	Select the boot option "Desktop Log in as user 'pi' at
			the graphical desktop."

			1.6.3.	Hit "FINISH" and reboot. Congrats! Your desktop should be
			all set and you're ready to go.

2. Preliminaries
----------------

	2.1.	Run the following commands in the terminal.
			(Make sure that you're connected to the internet first.)

			2.1.1.	sudo apt-get update
			2.1.2.	sudo apt-get install git

	2.2.	Create a new folder, and navigate to that folder in the terminal.

			!	2.2.1.	git clone https://github.com/crentagon/rbpi_thesis
			!	The above will only work once the project has been completed.

			2.2.1.	git init
			2.2.2.	git remote add origin https://github.com/crentagon/rbpi_thesis
			2.2.3.	git pull origin master

	2.3.	Setting the resolution of your monitor, if need to:

			2.3.1.	tvservice -d edid
			2.3.2.	edidparser edid

			2.3.3.	Before the line "HDMI:EDID preferred mode remained as..."
					at the bottom of edid, select the resolution that you desire.
			2.3.4.	In my case, I want my resolution to be:

					"HDMI:EDID CEA mode (4) 1280x720p @ 60 Hz with pixel clock..."

			2.3.5.	sudo nano /boot/config.txt
			2.3.6.	Look for the lines

					# hdmi_group = x
					# hdmi_mode = y

			2.3.7.	Take out the hashtags and then:

					2.3.7.1.	Change x to 1 if it's CEA
					2.3.7.2.	Change x to 2 if it's DMT
					2.3.7.3.	Change y to the number in parenthesis, in my
								case, 4.

			2.3.8.	Press CTRL+X to close nano and reboot with sudo reboot.
					Your monitor should be at the right resolution right now.

	2.4.	Changing the Keyboard Layout

			2.4.1.	sudo raspi-config
			2.4.2.	Select the fourth option and choose keyboard settings.
			2.4.3.	Reboot for the changes to take effect.

3. Required Installation
------------------------

	3.1.	Installation for the OLED

			3.1.1.	sudo apt-get install git-core
			3.1.2.	sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

					3.1.2.1.	Comment out the following line by adding
								a hashtag before it:

									blacklist spi-bcm2708

					3.1.2.1.	It should look like this:

									# blacklist spi-bcm2708

			3.1.3.	git clone https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/OLED
					Make sure to navigate to the right folder first.

			3.1.4.	cd OLED

			3.1.5.	sh OLEDinstall.sh

	3.2.	Installation for the RFID

			3.2.0.  sudo raspi-config
					Use the arrow keys to navigate to: 8 Advanced Options
					Choose "A7 Serial"
					Choose No

			3.2.1.	wget https://libnfc.googlecode.com/archive/libnfc-1.7.0.tar.gz
					Make sure to navigate to the right folder first.

			3.2.2.	tar -xvzf libnfc-1.7.0.tar.gz

			3.2.3.	cd libnfc-libnfc-1.7.0
					sudo mkdir /etc/nfc
					sudo mkdir /etc/nfc/devices.d
					sudo cp contrib/libnfc/pn532_uart_on_rpi.conf.sample /etc/nfc/devices.d/pn532_uart_on_rpi.conf

			3.2.4.	sudo nano /etc/nfc/devices.d/pn532_uart_on_rpi.conf
					allow_intrusive_scan = true

			3.2.5.	sudo apt-get install autoconf
					sudo apt-get install libtool
					sudo apt-get install libpcsclite-dev libusb-dev
					autoreconf -vis
					./configure --with-drivers=pn532_uart --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr
